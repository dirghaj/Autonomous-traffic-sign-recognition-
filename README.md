# Autonomous-traffic-sign-recognition-system 

Utilising a convolutional neural network (CNN), this study develops an autonomous traffic sign recognition system. It may be expanded to work with real-time video feeds for autonomous vehicle applications. It first processes photos of traffic signs and categorises them.
Features: 
1. Traffic Sign Classification: Recognizes different traffic signs using the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset.
2. CNN Model
3. Data Augmentation
4. Real-Time Video Recognition
5. Software and Libraries: Python 3.x,TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Scikit-learn.
6. Hardware: A computer with a webcam and A GPU is recommended for faster model training but is optional.
